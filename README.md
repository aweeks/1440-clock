# 1440-clock

> A simple clock that visualizes the 1,440 precious minutes each of us has in a

## Motivation

I wanted a simple visualization of the 1,440 precious minutes each of us has in
a day. By default, this clock shows you a visual countdown of the minutes you
have remaining before midnight.

## Usage

To change the starting hour or minute, you can set it with the `sh` or `sm`
query params. For example, here we're setting the starting time to `21:30`:
